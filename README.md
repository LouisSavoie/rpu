Build real world habits and skills by turning your life into a Role Playing Game!

Create your character and add skills to it that you want to get better at. Then go practice! When you're done, you can post a short message about what you did and even add a picture if you have one. Every time you post, the related skill will increase. If it increases 10 times, that skill levels up! Also... YOU level up! Congrats :D
